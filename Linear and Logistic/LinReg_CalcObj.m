%function that outputs the value of the loss function L(w) we want to minimize.

%Input
%XTrain : NxK+1 matrix containing N number of K+1 dimensional training features
%yTrain : Nx1 vector containing the actual output for the training features
%OR
%XTest  : nxK+1 matrix containing n number of K+1 dimensional testing features
%yTest  : nx1 vector containing the actual output for the testing features
%w      : weight vector of appropriate dimensions

%Output
%loss   : The value of the loss function we want to minimize

function [loss] = LinReg_CalcObj (X, y, w)

n=size(X,1);
loss=(1/n)*(norm((X*w-y),2).^2);

endfunction
